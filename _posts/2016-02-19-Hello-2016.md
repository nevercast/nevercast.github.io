Today was my orientation day at Uni! I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Canterbury and the welcoming thing was sweet! Got to meet a whole lot of people, mostly lecturers and coordinators and help staff, not yet found people doing the same things as me but I hope the best for Monday in that regard.

Turns out I didn't actually have a prerequisite course in my schedule for next year which a coordinator discovered so that's been fixed up. Turns out I'll be studying stats as well. My other subjects besides Computer Science are Math and Physics.
