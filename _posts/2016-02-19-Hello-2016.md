## Uni

Today was my orientation day at Uni! I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Canterbury and the welcoming thing was sweet! Got to meet a whole lot of people, mostly lecturers and coordinators and help staff, not yet found people doing the same things as me but I hope the best for Monday in that regard.

My subjects besides Computer Science are Math (Algebra and Calculus), Physics and Statistics.

Statistics was a last minute add, if I want to do cryptography in 2 years I need Stats as a prerequisite. I was not aware of this and didn't initially add it. Fortunately I spoke to a course coordinator and they discovered the missing course and fixed it up for me.

## Work

I expect to still be working during study for the next few years. My current job is an IT instructor. I teach programming, PC hardware and Networking. We cover certs like Network+, CCNA, Cisco Wireless, Linux+, Windows Technician certs, Redhat Linux, Windows Server Infrastructure, Exchange server, Project+ and a whole lot more!

I've changed from working fulltime to part-time/casual. I don't know what my minimum hours are but I'll find that out on Monday!

## Blog

Last but certainly not least is this blog, it now exists. It is hosted by Github Pages, a static website hosting service for users and projects on Github. It's entirely free also.

The posts are written in Markdown and processed by the static blogging engine, Jekyll. Jekyll has a small pre-processor in it called Liquid which allows for iterating data such as my posts. It's effectively a blogging engine without any databases and instead builds your site in to static content every time I commit a change.

You can see the sourcecode for my blog here: [nevercast.github.io](https://github.com/nevercast/nevercast.github.io)

Jekyll is not revealed here as that is run by Github servers in the background.

Read about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This ends my first post. I'll continue to post to the blog and the website layout is very likely to change in time. I expect to have more pages in the coming months and will be adding features to the blog such as tags and categories.

Farewell.
