## Tags!

I now have experimental tags working on this blog. You can view the tag listing [here](/blog/tag) and the tags are also displayed on posts and index pages. Clicking them links to an anchor on the tag page which is dynamically generated.

Credit has to go to @codinfox. Related post [here](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/).
This post had a nice snipet of simplifying tags and categories and I've taken from it almost verbatim at this stage. As I become more
familar with the Liquid template engine my code will likely diverge to suit my own needs but having a leg up on the internet is always
a pleasure

## Categories?

The post linked above also mentioned categories, although not that differnet from tags it's something I'll consider in the future. 
Having some kind of *major* tag that allows me to break posts in to sections such as programming, blog, personal etc might be a nice
addition. Although tags will suffice fine in the meantime.

## Archives

One day in the future I expect to have enough posts that it spans many pages, so I'm going to need some archiving system for navigating
years and months. I will look in to implementing this in the next week or so.

## Signature

I'm in a habit of signing off the posts on my blog. <del>I think I'm going to have to add that to the template.</del>
